# lf-comp-challenge-2

I chose the best defense in the NFL, the Denver Broncos, as the subject for my static comp challenge. This challenge let me practice using flex and grid layouts in conjunction with one another. The biggest challenge I encountered in this project was aliging the cards just how I wanted them. I wanted the layout to reflect how the Broncos base defense lines up in what's called a 3-4-4. I used flex row reverse to accomplish this, but then controlling the page scaling was another challenge. I didn't want the cards to snap out of order until the phone reached it's mobile mode. This resulted in the use of more media queries than I found ideal, but it seemed like the best option to control the scaling of the background pictures, which were sized specifically for their given card.
